This program allows members of a VRChat group to vote for VRChat worlds taken from a list.

1. Node.js and npm must be installed.
2. `npm install`
3. Copy `config.example.json` into `config.json` and fill in the fields. You need a VRChat user and password, an IMAP user and password, your public e-mail address for VRChat API queries and a group ID for validations.
4. Make sure `favorites.json` is in the program directory. This is a dump generated by the VRChatFavorites [Rowboat](https://github.com/Protected/rowboat/) module using the `vrcsave LISTNAME json` command.
5. Run the program using `node .` or equivalent (you can run it in a gnu screen). If VRChat authentication completes properly the backend should be up and running.
6. Serve `index.html` to the public. If necessary, edit `REST_URL` to contain the full URL prefix required for reaching the backend from the frontend. Note that the backend doesn't take SSL and CORS considerations into account, so it's recommended to proxypass it through a proper webserver, ensuring it shares the same hostname as the frontend.
